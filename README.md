# gst-n-launch

## Install meson and ninja
Meson 0.48 or newer is required.
On Linux and macOS you can get meson through your package manager or using:
```
$ pip3 install --user meson
```
This will install meson into ~/.local/bin which may or may not be included
automatically in your PATH by default.

You should get ninja using your package manager or download the official
release and put the ninja
binary in your PATH.

## Build

meson build/
ninja -C build/


## Usage:

```
./gst-n-launch -b "videotestsrc ! autovideosink" -b "videotestsrc num-buffers=100 ! videoconvert ! autovidosink"
```
